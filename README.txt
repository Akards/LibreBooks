    This person just has a lot of data already assosciated with them

Professor Kirlin, 

We have made some changes to the site since Tuesday. We added 
the ability to create a new accountant account (although assosciating that account with
a business is still the job of a database admin), as well as a page to automatically 
buy and sell inventory called create sale. 

A few notes on the changes we made from our initial structure:

- All accountants can see and edit all acounts from a business, security level only
impacts their ability to delete invoices. Most accounting software doesn't
impliment a security level feature, so we were worried about the books becoming
unbalanced if we made accountants have limited access.
- We added Journal to view all the transactions that have been made on the 
database.
- Viewing accounts is its own page, rather than being shown on the 
'portal' webpage.
